# ScottyLabs Go

ScottyLabs Go is our internal URL bookmarking tool. Club members should be able to configure a path (go.scottylabs.org/path) to a specified URL (responsibly ofc).

## How to create Go links?

1. Make sure you have access to this [Google Sheet](https://go.scottylabs.org/routes).

:::tip
If you don't have access, request access from the [Tech Help Desk](https://mm.scottylabs.org/scottylabs/channels/tech-help-desk) channel in Mattermost.
:::

2. Add a new row at the bottom of the sheet and fill in the necessary info. The path must have the slash (`/`) symbol before it.

3. Click the refresh button at the top of the sheet. Please DO NOT spam this button.

:::warning
Do not overwrite the existing rows unless you know what you're doing.

## How to use the new Go link?

You can now use the Go link you just made (or found on the sheet) by adding the path to the end of `https://go.scottylabs.org`. So the path `/wdw` will be at `https://go.scottylabs.org/wdw`.
