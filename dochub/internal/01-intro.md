# ScottyLabs Internal Wiki

Some of our various internal tool documentation will go here.

## Internal tool documentation vs. project docs

#### When should content go in this wiki rather than the actual project's documentation?

This wiki is for step-by-step instructions on the user's side on how to use the internal
tools at ScottyLabs. On the other hand, project docs are for explaining how the tool
works at a technical level and the relevant API information.

#### Why are the two separate?

Some of our members are not actively working on tech projects, so they may have limited
context if we direct them to the technical docs. This wiki should explain in layman terms
how to use the tools.
