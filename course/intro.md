# What is the Course API?

This API is one of the core APIs that ScottyLabs maintains. It fetches information about courses at CMU and historical faculty course evaluation (FCE) data for each course as it is reported by the university.

The data we provide is from CMU and is not altered or produced in any way by our team.

For an example of our API in use, visit the [ScottyLabs Course Tool](https://cmucourses.com).
